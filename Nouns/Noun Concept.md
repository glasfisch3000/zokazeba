# Noun Word Structure

A noun in zokazeba is a word of at least one syllable.
A noun's last syllable (in nominative case) must consist of one onset consonant, the vowel `a` and no coda consonant.

A noun can be used in different [[Cases|cases]], depending on its role in a sentence.

# Definite and Indefinite Plurality

All zokazeba nouns can occur in one of three states that express different stages of plurality.
These precede any rules set by noun cases.

### Definite singular

The definite singular is equivalent to the english "the \[noun]". By using it, the speaker refers to one specific object, as specified by the given context.
It is the default case and does not change the noun's `-a` suffix.

### Indefinite

The indefinite state combines indefinite singular and plural, leaving the amount of referred objects to the context. It is the equivalent of saying, in english, "a/one \[noun]" or "some \[pl. nouns]".
In the indefinite state, the noun's `-a` suffix becomes `-ea`. As mentioned above, this precedes the changes applied by cases, so the genitive suffix becomes `-eavu`, dative becomes `-ea` and accusative `-eal`.
**Exception** for nouns ending in `-ya`: The indefinite `e` is replaced by `o` (`-oa`, `-oavu`, `-oa`, `-oal`).

### Definite Plural

The definite plural, similarly to the definite singular, refers to a specific set of nouns that is usually known from context. Its english equivalent is "the \[pl. nouns]".
The definite plural changes the noun's `-a` suffix to `-aka`. As with the indefinite state, this precedes any case rules, changing the genitive suffix to `-akavu`, the dative suffix to `-aka` and the accusative to `-akal`.
**Exception** for nouns ending in `-ka`: The plural `k` is replaced by `y` (`-aka`, `-akavu`, `-aka`, `-akal`).
