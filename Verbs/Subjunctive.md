# Subjunctive

The subjunctive form is an optional modification of an infinite or present- or past-tense conjugated verb.

It replaces the finite or infinite verb with the same form of the auxiliary verb `ami`, followed by the original verb in infinite form.

Examples:
- infinitive: `bezhi` → `ami bezhi`
- present-tense: `labezhe` → `lame bezhi`
- past-tense: `labezhire` → `lamire bezhi`
- future-tense: `laze bezhi` → `laze ami bezhi` (subjunctive is applied to the infinitive `bezhi`)
