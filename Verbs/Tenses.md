# Verb Tenses

Each conjugated verb is associated with and describes an action that is being done, will be done or has already been done. When conjugating a verb, the resulting word depends on the chosen time form.

### Present

The present tense is the most straight-forward one as well as the normal, usual, standard form for using a verb. It indicates that the described action is being performed at the present time, usually that is at the time that the speaker is declaring or describing it.

As it is the standard form, there are no additional rules for the present tense regarding the verb's structure.
Example: `bezhi` --(1st person sg., present)-> `labezhe`

### Future

The future tense indicates that the action is about to be performed or will be at a definite or indefinite point in future time. It can also be used to declare an intention of performing the action in the future.

To use the future tense, the conjugated verb is replaced by the corresponding present-tense conjugated form of the verb `zi`, followed by the original verb in infinite form.
Example: `bezhi` --(1st person sg., future)-> `laze bezhi`

### Past

The past tense indicates that an action has been performed in the past, not excluding the possibility that it is still being performed in the present or will be in the future.

The past tense alters the verb's suffix, where `-ir-` is inserted between the last syllable's onset and vowel.
Example: `bezhi` --(1st person sg., past)-> `labezhire`
