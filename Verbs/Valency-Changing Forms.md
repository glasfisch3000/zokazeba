# Passive

The passive form of a verb indicates that the associated action is being performed by a second or third party, targeting the subject, instead of the subject performing the action themselves.

It is derived from the word `moki` ("to take") and is applied by inserting `-ok-` between the last syllable's onset and vowel.

Examples:
- infinitive: `balzi` ("to hear") → `balzoki` ("to be heard")
- present-tense: `labalze` → `labalzoke`

# Causative

The causative form of a verb indicates that the subject causes a second or third party to perform the associated action, instead of performing the action themselves.

It utilises the word `duki` ("to give") as an auxiliary. In causative form, the word is replaced by the same form of `duki`, followed by the original word in infinite form.

Examples:
- infinitive: `kuzhi` ("to leave") → `duki kuzhi` ("to make someone leave", "to cause someone to leave")
- present-tense: `lakuzhe` → `laduke kuzhi`
