# Conjugated Verb Form

A verb can be conjugated in different forms to express an action being done.
To do this, the infinite verb's suffix is changed and a prefix may be appended. The word base however stays intact.

For each personal pronoun, there is a corresponding verb conjugation.
Additionally, there are the following imperative conjugations:
- 1st person plural
- 2nd person singular
- 2nd person plural

### Verbs Beginning with a Consonant

For verbs that begin with a consonant, a prefix syllable expressing person and plurality is attached to the beginning of the word. The suffix is changed to a vowel expressing plurality.

Indicative:

|                           | **prefix** | **suffix** | **example**                 |
| ------------------------- |:----------:|:----------:| --------------------------- |
| **singular – 1st person** |   `la-`    |    `-e`    | `labezhe` = i want          |
| **singular – 2nd person** |   `za-`    |    `-e`    | `zabezhe` = you (sg.) want  |
| **singular – 3rd person** |   `da-`    |    `-e`    | `dabezhe` = he/she/it wants |
| **plural – 1st person**   |   `lo-`    |    `-o`    | `lobezho` = we want         |
| **plural – 2nd person**   |   `zo-`    |    `-o`    | `zobezho` = you (pl.) want  |
| **plural – 3rd person**   |   `do-`    |    `-o`    | `dobezho` = they want       |

Imperative:

|                           | **prefix** | **suffix** | **example**             |

| **plural – 2nd person**   |   `zho-`   |    `-o`    | `zhoyedo!` = (pl.) eat! |

### Verbs Beginning with a Vowel

For verbs that begin with a vowel, meaning that their first syllable has no onset, that syllable's onset is created by attaching a prefix consonant that expressed the person. Furthermore, the verb's suffix is changed as described above, expressing plurality.

Indicative:

|                           | **prefix** | **suffix** | **example**                |
| ------------------------- |:----------:|:----------:| -------------------------- |

| **singular – 2nd person** |    `z-`    |    `-e`    | `zenye` = you (sg.) shine  |
| **singular – 3rd person** |    `d-`    |    `-e`    | `denye` = he/she/it shines |
| **plural – 1st person**   |    `l-`    |    `-o`    | `lenyo` = we shine         |
| **plural – 2nd person**   |    `z-`    |    `-o`    | `zenyo` = you (pl.) shine  |
| **plural – 3rd person**   |    `d-`    |    `-o`    | `denyo` = they shine       |

Imperative:

|                           | **prefix** | **suffix** | **example**                    |
