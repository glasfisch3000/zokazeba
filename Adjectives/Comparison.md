# Adjective Comparison Stages

An adjective can be used in three different stages of comparison, from which the positive is the standard form.

**Preposition usage:**

"\[adjective (comp.)] than \[object]" = \[adjective (comp.)] `nam` \[object]
"as \[adjective] as \[object]" = \[adjective] `dhod` \[object]

### Positive

The positive stage describes having the specified attribute.
As it is the normal stage, it is not associated with any modifications to the adjective.

### Comparative

The comparative stage describes having the specified attribute in a way more than a possible compared object.

Rule: \[adjective base]`arku`
Example: `mizu` → `mizarku`

**Exceptions:**

`ku` → `arku`
`koyu` → `karyu`
`dhu` → `ardhu`
`dhoyu` → `dharyu`

### Superlative

The superlative stage describes having the specified attribute in a way more than any and all possible compared objects.

Rule: \[adjective (positive)] `moku`
Example: `mizu` → `mizu moku`

**Exceptions:**
`ku` → `moku`
`koyu` → `komyu`
`dhu` → `modhu`
`dhoyu` → `dhomyu`
