# Basic Vowels

|            | **front** | **central** | **back** |
| ---------- | :-------: | :---------: | :------: |
| **high**   |    `i`    |             |   `u`    |
| **middle** |    `e`    |             |   `o`    |
| **low**    |           |     `a`     |          |

Vowels in zokazeba are usually spoken long, unless the syllable in question contains a coda consonant.
When a word ends in an unstressed `e`, that last vowel is spoken short.

# Double Vowels

In zokazeba, any non-stressed vowel may be explicitly declared as long by writing the vowel twice.
This also declares the vowel as stressed. The usual stress rules are superseded by this.

# Vowel Tuples

Zokazeba allows a specific set of double vowels instead of singular ones, depending on whether the syllable in question has a coda consonant.

Double vowels that can be placed before a coda are:
- `ea`
- `oa`

Double vowels that cannot be placed before a coda (and that therefore need to conclude a syllable) are:
- `ai`
- `au`
- `eo`
- `oe`
- `ui`
