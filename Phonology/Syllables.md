# Syllable Structure

In zokazeba, each syllable consists of a vowel that may be preceded by an optional consonant and succeeded by another optional consonant.
The resulting syllable pattern can be formulated as (C)V(C), where each C is replaced by a consonant and each V by a vowel.

A word may start or end in a vowel or consonant.
The rules for consonant codas and tuples are as specified in [[Consonants]].

# Stress

Each zokazeba word has one stressed syllable.
As a rule of thumb, a word's second-to-last syllable is usually stressed.
Example: `zokazEba`, `azhUra`

This is, obviously, not the case for words that only consist of one syllable.
Example: `nA`, `zhi`

Furthermore, when a word is constructed or derived from a base word, it inherits that base's stress rules.
Example: `zekAri` → `zekAriba`, `enIdha` → `enIdhiru`
