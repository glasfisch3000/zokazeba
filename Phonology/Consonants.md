# Consonant Codas

Zokazeba allows a syllable at the end of a word to end in any consonant but `y`.

### Consonant Tuples

Zokazeba allows a specific type of combination of two consonants between syllables, where one concludes a syllable and the other starts the next one.
One syllable must never begin or end with two consonants.
A consonant tuple must never contain of the same vowel twice.

A syllable may, as part of a double consonant, end in one of the following consonants:
- `m`
- `n`
- `l`
- `r`

A syllable whose predecessor ends in a consonant may begin with any consonant except that one.
